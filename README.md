# Voice vs Visual Interfaces API

This repository contains the source code for the Flask API built to control the settings of Hello Robot's Stretch. It allows us to have a REST API interface to connect with our Kotlin mobile application. 

## Research Abstract 

In our every-day interaction with digital mediums of all sorts (i.e. from robots to user
interfaces), personalization has become a critical step for establishing trust and usability.
In consumer robots, however, the process of personalization often requires the user to
become detached from the experience and switch to external devices such as
smartphones or web apps. Research in the field of human-computer interaction has
shown that voice interfaces can offer natural, intuitive ways to configure technology while
visual interfaces provide transparency and efficient feedback across complex tasks.
However, at large, we do not yet understand how the combination (and isolation) of each
of these modalities compare as it pertains to robot personalization and interaction. This
gap is exactly what this project tackles to better understand how voice-only, visual-only,
and hybrid interfaces influence our perceptions of control and primarily, the development
of mental models of tasks.
